<br>
From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,<br>
But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,<br>
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:<br>
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    2<br>
<br>
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,<br>
Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,<br>
If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
  This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    3<br>
<br>
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br>
Now is the time that face should form another,<br>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<br>
Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br>
Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee<br>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
  But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>
  Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    4<br>
<br>
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
Upon thy self thy beauty’s legacy?<br>
Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
Profitless usurer why dost thou use<br>
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br>
For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br>
  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
  Which used lives th’ executor to be.<br>
