<br>
From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,<br>
But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,<br>
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:<br>
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    2<br>
<br>
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,<br>
Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,<br>
If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
  This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    3<br>
<br>
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br>
Now is the time that face should form another,<br>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<br>
Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br>
Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee<br>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
  But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>
  Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    4<br>
<br>
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
Upon thy self thy beauty’s legacy?<br>
Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
Profitless usurer why dost thou use<br>
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br>
For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br>
  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
  Which used lives th’ executor to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    5<br>
<br>
Those hours that with gentle work did frame<br>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<br>
Will play the tyrants to the very same,<br>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<br>
For never-resting time leads summer on<br>
To hideous winter and confounds him there,<br>
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:<br>
Then were not summer’s distillation left<br>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.<br>
  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<br>
  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    6<br>
<br>
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,<br>
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:<br>
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,<br>
With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:<br>
That use is not forbidden usury,<br>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br>
That’s for thy self to breed another thee,<br>
Or ten times happier be it ten for one,<br>
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br>
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br>
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br>
Leaving thee living in posterity?<br>
  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,<br>
  To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    7<br>
<br>
Lo in the orient when the gracious light<br>
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br>
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br>
Serving with looks his sacred majesty,<br>
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<br>
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br>
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br>
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br>
But when from highmost pitch with weary car,<br>
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,<br>
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are<br>
From his low tract and look another way:<br>
  So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:<br>
  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    8<br>
<br>
Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?<br>
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br>
Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,<br>
Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?<br>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br>
By unions married do offend thine ear,<br>
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:<br>
Mark how one string sweet husband to another,<br>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br>
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,<br>
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br>
  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br>
  Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    9<br>
<br>
Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,<br>
That thou consum’st thy self in single life?<br>
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br>
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,<br>
The world will be thy widow and still weep,<br>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br>
When every private widow well may keep,<br>
By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:<br>
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br>
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br>
But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,<br>
And kept unused the user so destroys it:<br>
  No love toward others in that bosom sits<br>
  That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    10<br>
<br>
For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any<br>
Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br>
Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<br>
But that thou none lov’st is most evident:<br>
For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,<br>
That ’gainst thy self thou stick’st not to conspire,<br>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire:<br>
O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,<br>
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<br>
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,<br>
Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,<br>
  Make thee another self for love of me,<br>
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    11<br>
<br>
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,<br>
In one of thine, from that which thou departest,<br>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,<br>
Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,<br>
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,<br>
Without this folly, age, and cold decay,<br>
If all were minded so, the times should cease,<br>
And threescore year would make the world away:<br>
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br>
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br>
Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;<br>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br>
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br>
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    12<br>
<br>
When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,<br>
When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
And sable curls all silvered o’er with white:<br>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd<br>
And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves<br>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:<br>
Then of thy beauty do I question make<br>
That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br>
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,<br>
And die as fast as they see others grow,<br>
  And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence<br>
  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    13<br>
<br>
O that you were your self, but love you are<br>
No longer yours, than you your self here live,<br>
Against this coming end you should prepare,<br>
And your sweet semblance to some other give.<br>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br>
Find no determination, then you were<br>
Your self again after your self’s decease,<br>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br>
Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day<br>
And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?<br>
  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,<br>
  You had a father, let your son say so.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    14<br>
<br>
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,<br>
And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br>
But not to tell of good, or evil luck,<br>
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,<br>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;<br>
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br>
Or say with princes if it shall go well<br>
By oft predict that I in heaven find.<br>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br>
And constant stars in them I read such art<br>
As truth and beauty shall together thrive<br>
If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:<br>
  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,<br>
  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    15<br>
<br>
When I consider every thing that grows<br>
Holds in perfection but a little moment.<br>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.<br>
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br>
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:<br>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br>
And wear their brave state out of memory.<br>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,<br>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br>
Where wasteful time debateth with decay<br>
To change your day of youth to sullied night,<br>
  And all in war with Time for love of you,<br>
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    16<br>
<br>
But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?<br>
And fortify your self in your decay<br>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br>
And many maiden gardens yet unset,<br>
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br>
So should the lines of life that life repair<br>
Which this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen<br>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair<br>
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br>
  To give away your self, keeps your self still,<br>
  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    17<br>
<br>
Who will believe my verse in time to come<br>
If it were filled with your most high deserts?<br>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br>
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:<br>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br>
The age to come would say this poet lies,<br>
Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.<br>
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)<br>
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br>
And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage,<br>
And stretched metre of an antique song.<br>
  But were some child of yours alive that time,<br>
  You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    18<br>
<br>
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:<br>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,<br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:<br>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,<br>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,<br>
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    19<br>
<br>
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,<br>
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,<br>
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,<br>
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,<br>
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,<br>
And do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time<br>
To the wide world and all her fading sweets:<br>
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,<br>
O carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,<br>
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,<br>
Him in thy course untainted do allow,<br>
For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.<br>
  Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<br>
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    20<br>
<br>
A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,<br>
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,<br>
A woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted<br>
With shifting change as is false women’s fashion,<br>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:<br>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,<br>
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,<br>
Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.<br>
And for a woman wert thou first created,<br>
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,<br>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br>
  But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,<br>
  Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    21<br>
<br>
So is it not with me as with that muse,<br>
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,<br>
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,<br>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br>
Making a couplement of proud compare<br>
With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems:<br>
With April’s first-born flowers and all things rare,<br>
That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.<br>
O let me true in love but truly write,<br>
And then believe me, my love is as fair,<br>
As any mother’s child, though not so bright<br>
As those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:<br>
  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,<br>
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    22<br>
<br>
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br>
So long as youth and thou are of one date,<br>
But when in thee time’s furrows I behold,<br>
Then look I death my days should expiate.<br>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br>
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,<br>
How can I then be elder than thou art?<br>
O therefore love be of thyself so wary,<br>
As I not for my self, but for thee will,<br>
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary<br>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br>
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,<br>
  Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    23<br>
<br>
As an unperfect actor on the stage,<br>
Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br>
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br>
Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;<br>
So I for fear of trust, forget to say,<br>
The perfect ceremony of love’s rite,<br>
And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,<br>
O’ercharged with burthen of mine own love’s might:<br>
O let my looks be then the eloquence,<br>
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br>
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br>
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.<br>
  O learn to read what silent love hath writ,<br>
  To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    24<br>
<br>
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,<br>
Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart,<br>
My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,<br>
And perspective it is best painter’s art.<br>
For through the painter must you see his skill,<br>
To find where your true image pictured lies,<br>
Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,<br>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:<br>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,<br>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br>
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br>
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br>
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br>
  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    25<br>
<br>
Let those who are in favour with their stars,<br>
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br>
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars<br>
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;<br>
Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread,<br>
But as the marigold at the sun’s eye,<br>
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br>
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br>
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br>
After a thousand victories once foiled,<br>
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br>
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:<br>
  Then happy I that love and am beloved<br>
  Where I may not remove nor be removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    26<br>
<br>
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<br>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;<br>
To thee I send this written embassage<br>
To witness duty, not to show my wit.<br>
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br>
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;<br>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br>
In thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it:<br>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<br>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<br>
And puts apparel on my tattered loving,<br>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,<br>
  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,<br>
  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    27<br>
<br>
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,<br>
But then begins a journey in my head<br>
To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired.<br>
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)<br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see.<br>
Save that my soul’s imaginary sight<br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)<br>
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.<br>
  Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    28<br>
<br>
How can I then return in happy plight<br>
That am debarred the benefit of rest?<br>
When day’s oppression is not eased by night,<br>
