<br>
From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,<br>
But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,<br>
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:<br>
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    2<br>
<br>
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,<br>
Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,<br>
If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
  This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    3<br>
<br>
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br>
Now is the time that face should form another,<br>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<br>
Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br>
Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee<br>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
  But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>
  Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    4<br>
<br>
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
Upon thy self thy beauty’s legacy?<br>
Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
Profitless usurer why dost thou use<br>
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br>
For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br>
  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
  Which used lives th’ executor to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    5<br>
<br>
Those hours that with gentle work did frame<br>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<br>
Will play the tyrants to the very same,<br>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<br>
For never-resting time leads summer on<br>
To hideous winter and confounds him there,<br>
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:<br>
Then were not summer’s distillation left<br>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.<br>
  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<br>
  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    6<br>
<br>
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,<br>
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:<br>
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,<br>
With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:<br>
That use is not forbidden usury,<br>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br>
That’s for thy self to breed another thee,<br>
Or ten times happier be it ten for one,<br>
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br>
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br>
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br>
Leaving thee living in posterity?<br>
  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,<br>
  To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    7<br>
<br>
Lo in the orient when the gracious light<br>
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br>
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br>
Serving with looks his sacred majesty,<br>
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<br>
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br>
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br>
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br>
But when from highmost pitch with weary car,<br>
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,<br>
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are<br>
From his low tract and look another way:<br>
  So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:<br>
  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    8<br>
<br>
Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?<br>
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br>
Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,<br>
Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?<br>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br>
By unions married do offend thine ear,<br>
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:<br>
Mark how one string sweet husband to another,<br>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br>
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,<br>
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br>
  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br>
  Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    9<br>
<br>
Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,<br>
That thou consum’st thy self in single life?<br>
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br>
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,<br>
The world will be thy widow and still weep,<br>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br>
When every private widow well may keep,<br>
By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:<br>
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br>
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br>
But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,<br>
And kept unused the user so destroys it:<br>
  No love toward others in that bosom sits<br>
  That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    10<br>
<br>
For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any<br>
Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br>
Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<br>
But that thou none lov’st is most evident:<br>
For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,<br>
That ’gainst thy self thou stick’st not to conspire,<br>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire:<br>
O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,<br>
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<br>
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,<br>
Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,<br>
  Make thee another self for love of me,<br>
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    11<br>
<br>
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,<br>
In one of thine, from that which thou departest,<br>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,<br>
Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,<br>
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,<br>
Without this folly, age, and cold decay,<br>
If all were minded so, the times should cease,<br>
And threescore year would make the world away:<br>
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br>
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br>
Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;<br>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br>
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br>
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    12<br>
<br>
When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,<br>
When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
And sable curls all silvered o’er with white:<br>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd<br>
And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves<br>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:<br>
Then of thy beauty do I question make<br>
That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br>
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,<br>
And die as fast as they see others grow,<br>
  And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence<br>
  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    13<br>
<br>
O that you were your self, but love you are<br>
No longer yours, than you your self here live,<br>
Against this coming end you should prepare,<br>
And your sweet semblance to some other give.<br>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br>
Find no determination, then you were<br>
Your self again after your self’s decease,<br>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br>
Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day<br>
And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?<br>
  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,<br>
  You had a father, let your son say so.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    14<br>
<br>
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,<br>
And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br>
But not to tell of good, or evil luck,<br>
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,<br>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;<br>
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br>
Or say with princes if it shall go well<br>
By oft predict that I in heaven find.<br>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br>
And constant stars in them I read such art<br>
As truth and beauty shall together thrive<br>
If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:<br>
  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,<br>
  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    15<br>
<br>
When I consider every thing that grows<br>
Holds in perfection but a little moment.<br>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.<br>
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br>
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:<br>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br>
And wear their brave state out of memory.<br>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,<br>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br>
Where wasteful time debateth with decay<br>
To change your day of youth to sullied night,<br>
  And all in war with Time for love of you,<br>
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    16<br>
<br>
But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?<br>
And fortify your self in your decay<br>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br>
And many maiden gardens yet unset,<br>
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br>
So should the lines of life that life repair<br>
Which this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen<br>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair<br>
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br>
  To give away your self, keeps your self still,<br>
  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    17<br>
<br>
Who will believe my verse in time to come<br>
If it were filled with your most high deserts?<br>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br>
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:<br>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br>
The age to come would say this poet lies,<br>
Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.<br>
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)<br>
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br>
And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage,<br>
And stretched metre of an antique song.<br>
  But were some child of yours alive that time,<br>
  You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    18<br>
<br>
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:<br>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,<br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:<br>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,<br>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,<br>
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    19<br>
<br>
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,<br>
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,<br>
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,<br>
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,<br>
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,<br>
And do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time<br>
To the wide world and all her fading sweets:<br>
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,<br>
O carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,<br>
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,<br>
Him in thy course untainted do allow,<br>
For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.<br>
  Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<br>
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    20<br>
<br>
A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,<br>
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,<br>
A woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted<br>
With shifting change as is false women’s fashion,<br>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:<br>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,<br>
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,<br>
Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.<br>
And for a woman wert thou first created,<br>
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,<br>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br>
  But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,<br>
  Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    21<br>
<br>
So is it not with me as with that muse,<br>
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,<br>
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,<br>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br>
Making a couplement of proud compare<br>
With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems:<br>
With April’s first-born flowers and all things rare,<br>
That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.<br>
O let me true in love but truly write,<br>
And then believe me, my love is as fair,<br>
As any mother’s child, though not so bright<br>
As those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:<br>
  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,<br>
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    22<br>
<br>
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br>
So long as youth and thou are of one date,<br>
But when in thee time’s furrows I behold,<br>
Then look I death my days should expiate.<br>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br>
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,<br>
How can I then be elder than thou art?<br>
O therefore love be of thyself so wary,<br>
As I not for my self, but for thee will,<br>
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary<br>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br>
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,<br>
  Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    23<br>
<br>
As an unperfect actor on the stage,<br>
Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br>
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br>
Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;<br>
So I for fear of trust, forget to say,<br>
The perfect ceremony of love’s rite,<br>
And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,<br>
O’ercharged with burthen of mine own love’s might:<br>
O let my looks be then the eloquence,<br>
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br>
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br>
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.<br>
  O learn to read what silent love hath writ,<br>
  To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    24<br>
<br>
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,<br>
Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart,<br>
My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,<br>
And perspective it is best painter’s art.<br>
For through the painter must you see his skill,<br>
To find where your true image pictured lies,<br>
Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,<br>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:<br>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,<br>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br>
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br>
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br>
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br>
  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    25<br>
<br>
Let those who are in favour with their stars,<br>
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br>
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars<br>
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;<br>
Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread,<br>
But as the marigold at the sun’s eye,<br>
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br>
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br>
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br>
After a thousand victories once foiled,<br>
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br>
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:<br>
  Then happy I that love and am beloved<br>
  Where I may not remove nor be removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    26<br>
<br>
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<br>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;<br>
To thee I send this written embassage<br>
To witness duty, not to show my wit.<br>
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br>
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;<br>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br>
In thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it:<br>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<br>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<br>
And puts apparel on my tattered loving,<br>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,<br>
  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,<br>
  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    27<br>
<br>
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,<br>
But then begins a journey in my head<br>
To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired.<br>
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)<br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see.<br>
Save that my soul’s imaginary sight<br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)<br>
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.<br>
  Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    28<br>
<br>
How can I then return in happy plight<br>
That am debarred the benefit of rest?<br>
When day’s oppression is not eased by night,<br>
But day by night and night by day oppressed.<br>
And each (though enemies to either’s reign)<br>
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,<br>
The one by toil, the other to complain<br>
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.<br>
I tell the day to please him thou art bright,<br>
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:<br>
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,<br>
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.<br>
  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,<br>
  And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger<br>
<br>
<br>
                    29<br>
<br>
When in disgrace with Fortune and men’s eyes,<br>
I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br>
And look upon my self and curse my fate,<br>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br>
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br>
Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,<br>
With what I most enjoy contented least,<br>
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br>
(Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate,<br>
  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,<br>
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    30<br>
<br>
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,<br>
I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>
And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:<br>
Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)<br>
For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,<br>
And weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe,<br>
And moan th’ expense of many a vanished sight.<br>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er<br>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br>
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br>
  But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)<br>
  All losses are restored, and sorrows end.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    31<br>
<br>
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,<br>
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,<br>
And there reigns love and all love’s loving parts,<br>
And all those friends which I thought buried.<br>
How many a holy and obsequious tear<br>
Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye,<br>
As interest of the dead, which now appear,<br>
But things removed that hidden in thee lie.<br>
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,<br>
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,<br>
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,<br>
That due of many, now is thine alone.<br>
  Their images I loved, I view in thee,<br>
  And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    32<br>
<br>
If thou survive my well-contented day,<br>
When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover<br>
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<br>
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:<br>
Compare them with the bett’ring of the time,<br>
And though they be outstripped by every pen,<br>
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,<br>
Exceeded by the height of happier men.<br>
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,<br>
’Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,<br>
A dearer birth than this his love had brought<br>
To march in ranks of better equipage:<br>
  But since he died and poets better prove,<br>
  Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love’.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    33<br>
<br>
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,<br>
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green;<br>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:<br>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,<br>
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide<br>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br>
With all triumphant splendour on my brow,<br>
But out alack, he was but one hour mine,<br>
The region cloud hath masked him from me now.<br>
  Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,<br>
  Suns of the world may stain, when heaven’s sun staineth.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    34<br>
<br>
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,<br>
And make me travel forth without my cloak,<br>
To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,<br>
Hiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke?<br>
’Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<br>
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,<br>
For no man well of such a salve can speak,<br>
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:<br>
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,<br>
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,<br>
Th’ offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief<br>
To him that bears the strong offence’s cross.<br>
  Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,<br>
  And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    35<br>
<br>
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,<br>
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,<br>
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,<br>
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.<br>
All men make faults, and even I in this,<br>
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,<br>
My self corrupting salving thy amiss,<br>
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:<br>
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,<br>
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,<br>
And ’gainst my self a lawful plea commence:<br>
Such civil war is in my love and hate,<br>
  That I an accessary needs must be,<br>
  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    36<br>
<br>
Let me confess that we two must be twain,<br>
Although our undivided loves are one:<br>
So shall those blots that do with me remain,<br>
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.<br>
In our two loves there is but one respect,<br>
Though in our lives a separable spite,<br>
Which though it alter not love’s sole effect,<br>
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.<br>
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,<br>
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,<br>
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,<br>
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:<br>
  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,<br>
  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    37<br>
<br>
As a decrepit father takes delight,<br>
To see his active child do deeds of youth,<br>
So I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite<br>
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.<br>
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,<br>
Or any of these all, or all, or more<br>
Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,<br>
I make my love engrafted to this store:<br>
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,<br>
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,<br>
That I in thy abundance am sufficed,<br>
And by a part of all thy glory live:<br>
  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,<br>
  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    38<br>
<br>
How can my muse want subject to invent<br>
While thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse,<br>
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,<br>
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<br>
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,<br>
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,<br>
For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,<br>
When thou thy self dost give invention light?<br>
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth<br>
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,<br>
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth<br>
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.<br>
  If my slight muse do please these curious days,<br>
  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    39<br>
<br>
O how thy worth with manners may I sing,<br>
When thou art all the better part of me?<br>
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:<br>
And what is’t but mine own when I praise thee?<br>
Even for this, let us divided live,<br>
And our dear love lose name of single one,<br>
That by this separation I may give:<br>
That due to thee which thou deserv’st alone:<br>
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,<br>
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,<br>
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,<br>
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.<br>
  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,<br>
  By praising him here who doth hence remain.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    40<br>
<br>
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,<br>
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?<br>
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,<br>
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:<br>
Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,<br>
I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,<br>
But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest<br>
By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.<br>
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief<br>
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:<br>
And yet love knows it is a greater grief<br>
To bear greater wrong, than hate’s known injury.<br>
  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,<br>
  Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    41<br>
<br>
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,<br>
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,<br>
Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,<br>
For still temptation follows where thou art.<br>
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,<br>
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.<br>
And when a woman woos, what woman’s son,<br>
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?<br>
Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,<br>
And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,<br>
Who lead thee in their riot even there<br>
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:<br>
  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,<br>
  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    42<br>
<br>
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,<br>
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,<br>
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,<br>
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.<br>
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,<br>
Thou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her,<br>
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,<br>
Suff’ring my friend for my sake to approve her.<br>
If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,<br>
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,<br>
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,<br>
And both for my sake lay on me this cross,<br>
  But here’s the joy, my friend and I are one,<br>
  Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    43<br>
<br>
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,<br>
For all the day they view things unrespected,<br>
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,<br>
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.<br>
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright<br>
How would thy shadow’s form, form happy show,<br>
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<br>
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!<br>
How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,<br>
By looking on thee in the living day,<br>
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,<br>
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!<br>
  All days are nights to see till I see thee,<br>
  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    44<br>
<br>
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,<br>
Injurious distance should not stop my way,<br>
For then despite of space I would be brought,<br>
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,<br>
No matter then although my foot did stand<br>
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,<br>
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,<br>
As soon as think the place where he would be.<br>
But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought<br>
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,<br>
But that so much of earth and water wrought,<br>
I must attend, time’s leisure with my moan.<br>
  Receiving nought by elements so slow,<br>
  But heavy tears, badges of either’s woe.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    45<br>
<br>
The other two, slight air, and purging fire,<br>
Are both with thee, wherever I abide,<br>
The first my thought, the other my desire,<br>
These present-absent with swift motion slide.<br>
For when these quicker elements are gone<br>
In tender embassy of love to thee,<br>
My life being made of four, with two alone,<br>
Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.<br>
Until life’s composition be recured,<br>
By those swift messengers returned from thee,<br>
Who even but now come back again assured,<br>
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.<br>
  This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,<br>
  I send them back again and straight grow sad.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    46<br>
<br>
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,<br>
How to divide the conquest of thy sight,<br>
Mine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,<br>
My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,<br>
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,<br>
(A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)<br>
But the defendant doth that plea deny,<br>
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.<br>
To side this title is impanelled<br>
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,<br>
And by their verdict is determined<br>
The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.<br>
  As thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part,<br>
  And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    47<br>
<br>
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<br>
And each doth good turns now unto the other,<br>
When that mine eye is famished for a look,<br>
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;<br>
With my love’s picture then my eye doth feast,<br>
And to the painted banquet bids my heart:<br>
Another time mine eye is my heart’s guest,<br>
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.<br>
So either by thy picture or my love,<br>
Thy self away, art present still with me,<br>
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<br>
And I am still with them, and they with thee.<br>
  Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight<br>
  Awakes my heart, to heart’s and eye’s delight.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    48<br>
<br>
How careful was I when I took my way,<br>
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,<br>
That to my use it might unused stay<br>
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!<br>
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,<br>
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,<br>
Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,<br>
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.<br>
Thee have I not locked up in any chest,<br>
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,<br>
Within the gentle closure of my breast,<br>
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,<br>
  And even thence thou wilt be stol’n I fear,<br>
  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    49<br>
<br>
Against that time (if ever that time come)<br>
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,<br>
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,<br>
Called to that audit by advised respects,<br>
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,<br>
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,<br>
When love converted from the thing it was<br>
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;<br>
Against that time do I ensconce me here<br>
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,<br>
And this my hand, against my self uprear,<br>
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,<br>
  To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,<br>
  Since why to love, I can allege no cause.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    50<br>
<br>
How heavy do I journey on the way,<br>
When what I seek (my weary travel’s end)<br>
Doth teach that case and that repose to say<br>
’Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.’<br>
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<br>
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<br>
As if by some instinct the wretch did know<br>
His rider loved not speed being made from thee:<br>
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,<br>
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,<br>
Which heavily he answers with a groan,<br>
More sharp to me than spurring to his side,<br>
  For that same groan doth put this in my mind,<br>
  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    51<br>
<br>
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,<br>
Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,<br>
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?<br>
Till I return of posting is no need.<br>
O what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br>
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br>
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,<br>
In winged speed no motion shall I know,<br>
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,<br>
Therefore desire (of perfect’st love being made)<br>
Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,<br>
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,<br>
  Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,<br>
  Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    52<br>
<br>
So am I as the rich whose blessed key,<br>
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,<br>
The which he will not every hour survey,<br>
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.<br>
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,<br>
Since seldom coming in that long year set,<br>
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,<br>
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.<br>
So is the time that keeps you as my chest<br>
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,<br>
To make some special instant special-blest,<br>
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.<br>
  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,<br>
  Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    53<br>
<br>
What is your substance, whereof are you made,<br>
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?<br>
Since every one, hath every one, one shade,<br>
And you but one, can every shadow lend:<br>
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,<br>
Is poorly imitated after you,<br>
On Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set,<br>
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:<br>
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,<br>
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,<br>
The other as your bounty doth appear,<br>
And you in every blessed shape we know.<br>
  In all external grace you have some part,<br>
  But you like none, none you for constant heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    54<br>
<br>
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,<br>
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!<br>
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br>
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:<br>
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,<br>
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,<br>
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,<br>
When summer’s breath their masked buds discloses:<br>
But for their virtue only is their show,<br>
They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,<br>
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,<br>
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:<br>
  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<br>
  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    55<br>
<br>
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br>
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,<br>
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br>
Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.<br>
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br>
And broils root out the work of masonry,<br>
Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn:<br>
The living record of your memory.<br>
’Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity<br>
Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,<br>
Even in the eyes of all posterity<br>
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br>
  So till the judgment that your self arise,<br>
  You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    56<br>
<br>
Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said<br>
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,<br>
Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,<br>
To-morrow sharpened in his former might.<br>
So love be thou, although to-day thou fill<br>
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,<br>
To-morrow see again, and do not kill<br>
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:<br>
Let this sad interim like the ocean be<br>
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,<br>
Come daily to the banks, that when they see:<br>
Return of love, more blest may be the view.<br>
  Or call it winter, which being full of care,<br>
  Makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    57<br>
<br>
Being your slave what should I do but tend,<br>
Upon the hours, and times of your desire?<br>
I have no precious time at all to spend;<br>
Nor services to do till you require.<br>
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,<br>
Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,<br>
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,<br>
When you have bid your servant once adieu.<br>
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,<br>
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,<br>
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought<br>
Save where you are, how happy you make those.<br>
  So true a fool is love, that in your will,<br>
  (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    58<br>
<br>
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,<br>
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,<br>
Or at your hand th’ account of hours to crave,<br>
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.<br>
O let me suffer (being at your beck)<br>
Th’ imprisoned absence of your liberty,<br>
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,<br>
Without accusing you of injury.<br>
Be where you list, your charter is so strong,<br>
That you your self may privilage your time<br>
To what you will, to you it doth belong,<br>
Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.<br>
  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,<br>
  Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    59<br>
<br>
If there be nothing new, but that which is,<br>
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,<br>
Which labouring for invention bear amis<br>
The second burthen of a former child!<br>
O that record could with a backward look,<br>
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,<br>
Show me your image in some antique book,<br>
Since mind at first in character was done.<br>
That I might see what the old world could say,<br>
To this composed wonder of your frame,<br>
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,<br>
Or whether revolution be the same.<br>
  O sure I am the wits of former days,<br>
  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    60<br>
<br>
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,<br>
So do our minutes hasten to their end,<br>
Each changing place with that which goes before,<br>
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br>
Nativity once in the main of light,<br>
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,<br>
Crooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight,<br>
And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.<br>
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,<br>
And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,<br>
Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,<br>
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.<br>
  And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand<br>
  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    61<br>
<br>
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open<br>
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?<br>
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,<br>
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?<br>
Is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee<br>
So far from home into my deeds to pry,<br>
To find out shames and idle hours in me,<br>
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?<br>
O no, thy love though much, is not so great,<br>
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,<br>
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,<br>
To play the watchman ever for thy sake.<br>
  For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,<br>
  From me far off, with others all too near.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    62<br>
<br>
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,<br>
And all my soul, and all my every part;<br>
And for this sin there is no remedy,<br>
It is so grounded inward in my heart.<br>
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,<br>
No shape so true, no truth of such account,<br>
And for my self mine own worth do define,<br>
As I all other in all worths surmount.<br>
But when my glass shows me my self indeed<br>
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,<br>
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:<br>
Self, so self-loving were iniquity.<br>
  ’Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,<br>
  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    63<br>
<br>
Against my love shall be as I am now<br>
With Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’erworn,<br>
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow<br>
With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn<br>
Hath travelled on to age’s steepy night,<br>
And all those beauties whereof now he’s king<br>
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,<br>
Stealing away the treasure of his spring:<br>
For such a time do I now fortify<br>
Against confounding age’s cruel knife,<br>
That he shall never cut from memory<br>
My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life.<br>
  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,<br>
  And they shall live, and he in them still green.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    64<br>
<br>
When I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced<br>
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,<br>
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,<br>
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.<br>
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain<br>
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,<br>
And the firm soil win of the watery main,<br>
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.<br>
When I have seen such interchange of State,<br>
Or state it self confounded, to decay,<br>
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate<br>
That Time will come and take my love away.<br>
  This thought is as a death which cannot choose<br>
  But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    65<br>
<br>
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<br>
But sad mortality o’ersways their power,<br>
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<br>
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?<br>
O how shall summer’s honey breath hold out,<br>
Against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days,<br>
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,<br>
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?<br>
O fearful meditation, where alack,<br>
Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?<br>
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,<br>
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?<br>
  O none, unless this miracle have might,<br>
  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    66<br>
<br>
Tired with all these for restful death I cry,<br>
As to behold desert a beggar born,<br>
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,<br>
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br>
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,<br>
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br>
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,<br>
And strength by limping sway disabled<br>
And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br>
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,<br>
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,<br>
And captive good attending captain ill.<br>
  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,<br>
  Save that to die, I leave my love alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    67<br>
<br>
Ah wherefore with infection should he live,<br>
And with his presence grace impiety,<br>
That sin by him advantage should achieve,<br>
And lace it self with his society?<br>
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,<br>
And steal dead seeming of his living hue?<br>
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,<br>
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?<br>
Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,<br>
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,<br>
For she hath no exchequer now but his,<br>
And proud of many, lives upon his gains?<br>
  O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,<br>
  In days long since, before these last so bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    68<br>
<br>
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,<br>
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,<br>
Before these bastard signs of fair were born,<br>
Or durst inhabit on a living brow:<br>
Before the golden tresses of the dead,<br>
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,<br>
To live a second life on second head,<br>
Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay:<br>
In him those holy antique hours are seen,<br>
Without all ornament, it self and true,<br>
Making no summer of another’s green,<br>
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,<br>
  And him as for a map doth Nature store,<br>
  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    69<br>
<br>
Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view,<br>
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:<br>
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,<br>
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.<br>
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,<br>
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,<br>
In other accents do this praise confound<br>
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.<br>
They look into the beauty of thy mind,<br>
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,<br>
Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)<br>
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:<br>
  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,<br>
  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    70<br>
<br>
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,<br>
For slander’s mark was ever yet the fair,<br>
The ornament of beauty is suspect,<br>
A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.<br>
So thou be good, slander doth but approve,<br>
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,<br>
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,<br>
And thou present’st a pure unstained prime.<br>
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,<br>
Either not assailed, or victor being charged,<br>
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,<br>
To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,<br>
  If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,<br>
  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    71<br>
<br>
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,<br>
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell<br>
Give warning to the world that I am fled<br>
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:<br>
Nay if you read this line, remember not,<br>
The hand that writ it, for I love you so,<br>
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,<br>
If thinking on me then should make you woe.<br>
O if (I say) you look upon this verse,<br>
When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,<br>
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;<br>
But let your love even with my life decay.<br>
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan,<br>
  And mock you with me after I am gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    72<br>
<br>
O lest the world should task you to recite,<br>
What merit lived in me that you should love<br>
After my death (dear love) forget me quite,<br>
For you in me can nothing worthy prove.<br>
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,<br>
To do more for me than mine own desert,<br>
And hang more praise upon deceased I,<br>
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:<br>
O lest your true love may seem false in this,<br>
That you for love speak well of me untrue,<br>
My name be buried where my body is,<br>
And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.<br>
  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,<br>
  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    73<br>
<br>
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,<br>
When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang<br>
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br>
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<br>
In me thou seest the twilight of such day,<br>
As after sunset fadeth in the west,<br>
Which by and by black night doth take away,<br>
Death’s second self that seals up all in rest.<br>
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,<br>
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,<br>
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,<br>
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.<br>
  This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,<br>
  To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    74<br>
<br>
But be contented when that fell arrest,<br>
Without all bail shall carry me away,<br>
My life hath in this line some interest,<br>
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.<br>
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,<br>
The very part was consecrate to thee,<br>
The earth can have but earth, which is his due,<br>
My spirit is thine the better part of me,<br>
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,<br>
The prey of worms, my body being dead,<br>
The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife,<br>
Too base of thee to be remembered,<br>
  The worth of that, is that which it contains,<br>
  And that is this, and this with thee remains.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    75<br>
<br>
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,<br>
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;<br>
And for the peace of you I hold such strife<br>
As ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found.<br>
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon<br>
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,<br>
Now counting best to be with you alone,<br>
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,<br>
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,<br>
And by and by clean starved for a look,<br>
Possessing or pursuing no delight<br>
Save what is had, or must from you be took.<br>
  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,<br>
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    76<br>
<br>
Why is my verse so barren of new pride?<br>
So far from variation or quick change?<br>
Why with the time do I not glance aside<br>
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?<br>
Why write I still all one, ever the same,<br>
And keep invention in a noted weed,<br>
That every word doth almost tell my name,<br>
Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?<br>
O know sweet love I always write of you,<br>
And you and love are still my argument:<br>
So all my best is dressing old words new,<br>
Spending again what is already spent:<br>
  For as the sun is daily new and old,<br>
  So is my love still telling what is told.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    77<br>
<br>
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,<br>
These vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear,<br>
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.<br>
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,<br>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,<br>
Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know,<br>
Time’s thievish progress to eternity.<br>
Look what thy memory cannot contain,<br>
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<br>
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,<br>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<br>
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,<br>
  Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    78<br>
<br>
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,<br>
And found such fair assistance in my verse,<br>
As every alien pen hath got my use,<br>
And under thee their poesy disperse.<br>
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,<br>
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,<br>
Have added feathers to the learned’s wing,<br>
And given grace a double majesty.<br>
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,<br>
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,<br>
In others’ works thou dost but mend the style,<br>
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.<br>
  But thou art all my art, and dost advance<br>
  As high as learning, my rude ignorance.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    79<br>
<br>
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,<br>
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,<br>
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,<br>
And my sick muse doth give an other place.<br>
I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument<br>
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,<br>
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,<br>
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,<br>
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,<br>
From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give<br>
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford<br>
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.<br>
  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,<br>
  Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    80<br>
<br>
O how I faint when I of you do write,<br>
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,<br>
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,<br>
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.<br>
But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)<br>
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,<br>
My saucy bark (inferior far to his)<br>
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.<br>
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,<br>
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,<br>
Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,<br>
He of tall building, and of goodly pride.<br>
  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,<br>
  The worst was this, my love was my decay.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    81<br>
<br>
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,<br>
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,<br>
From hence your memory death cannot take,<br>
Although in me each part will be forgotten.<br>
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,<br>
Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,<br>
The earth can yield me but a common grave,<br>
When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie,<br>
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,<br>
Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,<br>
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,<br>
When all the breathers of this world are dead,<br>
  You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)<br>
  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    82<br>
<br>
I grant thou wert not married to my muse,<br>
And therefore mayst without attaint o’erlook<br>
The dedicated words which writers use<br>
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.<br>
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,<br>
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,<br>
And therefore art enforced to seek anew,<br>
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.<br>
And do so love, yet when they have devised,<br>
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,<br>
Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,<br>
In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.<br>
  And their gross painting might be better used,<br>
  Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    83<br>
<br>
I never saw that you did painting need,<br>
And therefore to your fair no painting set,<br>
I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,<br>
That barren tender of a poet’s debt:<br>
And therefore have I slept in your report,<br>
That you your self being extant well might show,<br>
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<br>
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.<br>
This silence for my sin you did impute,<br>
Which shall be most my glory being dumb,<br>
For I impair not beauty being mute,<br>
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.<br>
  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,<br>
  Than both your poets can in praise devise.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    84<br>
<br>
Who is it that says most, which can say more,<br>
Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?<br>
In whose confine immured is the store,<br>
Which should example where your equal grew.<br>
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,<br>
That to his subject lends not some small glory,<br>
But he that writes of you, if he can tell,<br>
That you are you, so dignifies his story.<br>
Let him but copy what in you is writ,<br>
Not making worse what nature made so clear,<br>
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,<br>
Making his style admired every where.<br>
  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,<br>
  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    85<br>
<br>
My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,<br>
While comments of your praise richly compiled,<br>
Reserve their character with golden quill,<br>
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.<br>
I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,<br>
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,<br>
To every hymn that able spirit affords,<br>
In polished form of well refined pen.<br>
Hearing you praised, I say ’tis so, ’tis true,<br>
And to the most of praise add something more,<br>
But that is in my thought, whose love to you<br>
(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,<br>
  Then others, for the breath of words respect,<br>
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    86<br>
<br>
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,<br>
Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,<br>
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,<br>
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?<br>
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,<br>
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?<br>
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night<br>
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.<br>
He nor that affable familiar ghost<br>
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,<br>
As victors of my silence cannot boast,<br>
I was not sick of any fear from thence.<br>
  But when your countenance filled up his line,<br>
  Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    87<br>
<br>
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br>
And like enough thou know’st thy estimate,<br>
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:<br>
My bonds in thee are all determinate.<br>
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,<br>
And for that riches where is my deserving?<br>
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br>
And so my patent back again is swerving.<br>
Thy self thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,<br>
Or me to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking,<br>
So thy great gift upon misprision growing,<br>
Comes home again, on better judgement making.<br>
  Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,<br>
  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    88<br>
<br>
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,<br>
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,<br>
Upon thy side, against my self I’ll fight,<br>
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:<br>
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,<br>
Upon thy part I can set down a story<br>
Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:<br>
That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:<br>
And I by this will be a gainer too,<br>
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,<br>
The injuries that to my self I do,<br>
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.<br>
  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,<br>
  That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    89<br>
<br>
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,<br>
And I will comment upon that offence,<br>
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:<br>
Against thy reasons making no defence.<br>
Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,<br>
To set a form upon desired change,<br>
As I’ll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,<br>
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:<br>
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,<br>
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,<br>
Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:<br>
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.<br>
  For thee, against my self I’ll vow debate,<br>
  For I must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    90<br>
<br>
Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,<br>
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,<br>
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,<br>
And do not drop in for an after-loss:<br>
Ah do not, when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow,<br>
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,<br>
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,<br>
To linger out a purposed overthrow.<br>
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,<br>
When other petty griefs have done their spite,<br>
But in the onset come, so shall I taste<br>
At first the very worst of fortune’s might.<br>
  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,<br>
  Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    91<br>
<br>
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,<br>
Some in their wealth, some in their body’s force,<br>
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:<br>
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.<br>
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,<br>
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,<br>
But these particulars are not my measure,<br>
All these I better in one general best.<br>
Thy love is better than high birth to me,<br>
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ costs,<br>
Of more delight than hawks and horses be:<br>
And having thee, of all men’s pride I boast.<br>
  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,<br>
  All this away, and me most wretchcd make.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    92<br>
<br>
But do thy worst to steal thy self away,<br>
For term of life thou art assured mine,<br>
And life no longer than thy love will stay,<br>
For it depends upon that love of thine.<br>
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,<br>
When in the least of them my life hath end,<br>
I see, a better state to me belongs<br>
Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.<br>
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,<br>
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,<br>
O what a happy title do I find,<br>
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!<br>
  But what’s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?<br>
  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    93<br>
<br>
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,<br>
Like a deceived husband, so love’s face,<br>
May still seem love to me, though altered new:<br>
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.<br>
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,<br>
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,<br>
In many’s looks, the false heart’s history<br>
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.<br>
But heaven in thy creation did decree,<br>
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,<br>
Whate’er thy thoughts, or thy heart’s workings be,<br>
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.<br>
  How like Eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow,<br>
  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    94<br>
<br>
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,<br>
That do not do the thing, they most do show,<br>
Who moving others, are themselves as stone,<br>
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:<br>
They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces,<br>
And husband nature’s riches from expense,<br>
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,<br>
Others, but stewards of their excellence:<br>
The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,<br>
Though to it self, it only live and die,<br>
But if that flower with base infection meet,<br>
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:<br>
  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,<br>
  Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    95<br>
<br>
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,<br>
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,<br>
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!<br>
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!<br>
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,<br>
(Making lascivious comments on thy sport)<br>
Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,<br>
Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.<br>
O what a mansion have those vices got,<br>
Which for their habitation chose out thee,<br>
Where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot,<br>
And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!<br>
  Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,<br>
  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    96<br>
<br>
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,<br>
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,<br>
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:<br>
Thou mak’st faults graces, that to thee resort:<br>
As on the finger of a throned queen,<br>
The basest jewel will be well esteemed:<br>
So are those errors that in thee are seen,<br>
To truths translated, and for true things deemed.<br>
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,<br>
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<br>
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<br>
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<br>
  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,<br>
  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    97<br>
<br>
How like a winter hath my absence been<br>
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br>
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br>
What old December’s bareness everywhere!<br>
And yet this time removed was summer’s time,<br>
The teeming autumn big with rich increase,<br>
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br>
Like widowed wombs after their lords’ decease:<br>
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me<br>
But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,<br>
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br>
And thou away, the very birds are mute.<br>
  Or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer,<br>
  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    98<br>
<br>
From you have I been absent in the spring,<br>
When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)<br>
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:<br>
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.<br>
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell<br>
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,<br>
Could make me any summer’s story tell:<br>
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:<br>
Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,<br>
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,<br>
They were but sweet, but figures of delight:<br>
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.<br>
  Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,<br>
  As with your shadow I with these did play.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    99<br>
<br>
The forward violet thus did I chide,<br>
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,<br>
If not from my love’s breath? The purple pride<br>
Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,<br>
In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.<br>
The lily I condemned for thy hand,<br>
And buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair,<br>
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,<br>
One blushing shame, another white despair:<br>
A third nor red, nor white, had stol’n of both,<br>
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,<br>
But for his theft in pride of all his growth<br>
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.<br>
  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,<br>
  But sweet, or colour it had stol’n from thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    100<br>
<br>
Where art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long,<br>
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<br>
Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<br>
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<br>
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,<br>
In gentle numbers time so idly spent,<br>
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,<br>
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.<br>
Rise resty Muse, my love’s sweet face survey,<br>
If time have any wrinkle graven there,<br>
If any, be a satire to decay,<br>
And make time’s spoils despised everywhere.<br>
  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,<br>
  So thou prevent’st his scythe, and crooked knife.<br>

O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,<br>
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?<br>
Both truth and beauty on my love depends:<br>
So dost thou too, and therein dignified:<br>
Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,<br>
’Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,<br>
Beauty no pencil, beauty’s truth to lay:<br>
But best is best, if never intermixed’?<br>
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?<br>
Excuse not silence so, for’t lies in thee,<br>
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:<br>
And to be praised of ages yet to be.<br>
  Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,<br>
  To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    102<br>
<br>
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,<br>
I love not less, though less the show appear,<br>
That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,<br>
The owner’s tongue doth publish every where.<br>
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,<br>
When I was wont to greet it with my lays,<br>
As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,<br>
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:<br>
Not that the summer is less pleasant now<br>
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<br>
But that wild music burthens every bough,<br>
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<br>
  Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:<br>
  Because I would not dull you with my song.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    103<br>
<br>
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,<br>
That having such a scope to show her pride,<br>
The argument all bare is of more worth<br>
Than when it hath my added praise beside.<br>
O blame me not if I no more can write!<br>
Look in your glass and there appears a face,<br>
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,<br>
Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.<br>
Were it not sinful then striving to mend,<br>
To mar the subject that before was well?<br>
For to no other pass my verses tend,<br>
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.<br>
  And more, much more than in my verse can sit,<br>
  Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    104<br>
<br>
To me fair friend you never can be old,<br>
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,<br>
Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,<br>
Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride,<br>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,<br>
In process of the seasons have I seen,<br>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,<br>
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.<br>
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,<br>
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,<br>
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand<br>
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.<br>
  For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,<br>
  Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    105<br>
<br>
Let not my love be called idolatry,<br>
Nor my beloved as an idol show,<br>
Since all alike my songs and praises be<br>
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.<br>
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,<br>
Still constant in a wondrous excellence,<br>
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,<br>
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.<br>
Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,<br>
Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,<br>
And in this change is my invention spent,<br>
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.<br>
  Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.<br>
  Which three till now, never kept seat in one.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    106<br>
<br>
When in the chronicle of wasted time,<br>
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,<br>
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,<br>
In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,<br>
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,<br>
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,<br>
I see their antique pen would have expressed,<br>
Even such a beauty as you master now.<br>
So all their praises are but prophecies<br>
Of this our time, all you prefiguring,<br>
And for they looked but with divining eyes,<br>
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:<br>
  For we which now behold these present days,<br>
  Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    107<br>
<br>
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,<br>
Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,<br>
Can yet the lease of my true love control,<br>
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.<br>
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,<br>
And the sad augurs mock their own presage,<br>
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,<br>
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.<br>
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,<br>
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,<br>
Since spite of him I’ll live in this poor rhyme,<br>
While he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes.<br>
  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,<br>
  When tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    108<br>
<br>
What’s in the brain that ink may character,<br>
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,<br>
What’s new to speak, what now to register,<br>
That may express my love, or thy dear merit?<br>
Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,<br>
I must each day say o’er the very same,<br>
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,<br>
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.<br>
So that eternal love in love’s fresh case,<br>
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,<br>
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,<br>
But makes antiquity for aye his page,<br>
  Finding the first conceit of love there bred,<br>
  Where time and outward form would show it dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    109<br>
<br>
O never say that I was false of heart,<br>
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,<br>
As easy might I from my self depart,<br>
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:<br>
That is my home of love, if I have ranged,<br>
Like him that travels I return again,<br>
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,<br>
So that my self bring water for my stain,<br>
Never believe though in my nature reigned,<br>
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,<br>
That it could so preposterously be stained,<br>
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:<br>
  For nothing this wide universe I call,<br>
  Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    110<br>
<br>
Alas ’tis true, I have gone here and there,<br>
And made my self a motley to the view,<br>
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<br>
Made old offences of affections new.<br>
Most true it is, that I have looked on truth<br>
Askance and strangely: but by all above,<br>
These blenches gave my heart another youth,<br>
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.<br>
Now all is done, have what shall have no end,<br>
Mine appetite I never more will grind<br>
On newer proof, to try an older friend,<br>
A god in love, to whom I am confined.<br>
  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,<br>
  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    111<br>
<br>
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,<br>
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,<br>
That did not better for my life provide,<br>
Than public means which public manners breeds.<br>
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,<br>
And almost thence my nature is subdued<br>
To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:<br>
Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,<br>
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,<br>
Potions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection,<br>
No bitterness that I will bitter think,<br>
Nor double penance to correct correction.<br>
  Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,<br>
  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    112<br>
<br>
Your love and pity doth th’ impression fill,<br>
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,<br>
For what care I who calls me well or ill,<br>
So you o’er-green my bad, my good allow?<br>
You are my all the world, and I must strive,<br>
To know my shames and praises from your tongue,<br>
None else to me, nor I to none alive,<br>
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.<br>
In so profound abysm I throw all care<br>
Of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense,<br>
To critic and to flatterer stopped are:<br>
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.<br>
  You are so strongly in my purpose bred,<br>
  That all the world besides methinks are dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    113<br>
<br>
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,<br>
And that which governs me to go about,<br>
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,<br>
Seems seeing, but effectually is out:<br>
For it no form delivers to the heart<br>
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,<br>
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,<br>
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:<br>
For if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight,<br>
The most sweet favour or deformed’st creature,<br>
The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:<br>
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.<br>
  Incapable of more, replete with you,<br>
  My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    114<br>
<br>
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you<br>
Drink up the monarch’s plague this flattery?<br>
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,<br>
And that your love taught it this alchemy?<br>
To make of monsters, and things indigest,<br>
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,<br>
Creating every bad a perfect best<br>
As fast as objects to his beams assemble:<br>
O ’tis the first, ’tis flattery in my seeing,<br>
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,<br>
